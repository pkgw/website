Following up on
[my previous post](@/2013/slides-for-scientific-talks-in-html.md), I spent an
hour hacking together my slide template with a little project called
[d3po](https://github.com/adrn/d3po), a hack from the recent
[dotAstronomy 5](https://www.dotastronomy.com/five/) conference that’s put
together some demos presenting astronomical data with the
[d3](http://d3js.org/) toolkit.

{{ulink(path="d3pohack/", text="Here’s the result")}}. It’s just a quick
simple hack showing that this is possible, which in a way isn’t too impressive
since there’s absolutely no reason it shouldn’t have been. But it’s still fun
to see everything work.

Source code is available in the documents themselves, since this is the web!

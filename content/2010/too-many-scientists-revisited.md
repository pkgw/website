I thought I’d flag that the article about the oversupply of US PhDs that
[appeared in Scientific American in April](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/does-the-us-produce-too-m/)
and that [I discussed](@/2010/does-the-u-s-produce-too-many-scientists.md) has
[resurfaced in expanded form](https://psmag.com/social-justice/the-real-science-gap-16191)
(same author, Beryl Lieff Benderly) in the Miller-McCune (now
[Pacific Standard](https://psmag.com/) online magazine. The basic thrust is
essentially the same as before: the crisis in scientific careers is that there
aren’t sufficient (or, perhaps, worthy) career opportunities for newly minted
PhDs, not that there are insufficient numbers of potential American
scientists.

I still agree that the thesis is correct, though this article in particular
seems to endorse the idea that it’s really rough to be a graduate student or
postdoc, which is only true in a very limited sense. Unlike the previous
iteration, this article also argues that US science and math scores are
generally strong, and rising, at the K-12 and college levels. I’m not familiar
with the numbers, and I could believe that this is true, but having seen
average Berkeley students try to work with fractions, even if it is true, we
need to do better.

As a side note, I’ve never heard of this Miller-McCune thing; it seems to be a
relatively new organization funded by essentially one wealthy person. Given
that, the website is pretty professional-looking and there’s a lot of content.
Generally seems to be an earnest endeavor.

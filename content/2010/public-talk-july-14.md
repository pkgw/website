I’m giving another rendition of my radio astronomy talk, to the
[Sonoma County Astronomical Society](http://www.sonomaskies.org/), on
Wednesday, July 14th, at 7:30 PM. The talk will take place at the
[Proctor Terrace School](https://www.srcschools.org/Page/2236)
in Santa Rosa. The abstract is once again identical to that of
[September’s edition](@/2009/public-talk-september-11.md). See you then!

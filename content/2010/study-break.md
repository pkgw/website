Hereâ€™s a neat image that I made of the Cygnus OB-2 region, centered on Cygus
X-3, from a bunch of ATA data:

An ATA image of the Cygnus OB-2 region at 3.09 GHz, centered on Cyg X-3. Flux density scale is Janskys. Bandwidth is 180 MHz. The synthesized beam is indicated in the bottom left corner but it's a bit hard to make out. [Full size version](../../../wp/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/cygx3-large.png).

title = "Awarded a 2025 Better Scientific Software Fellowship"
+++

I’m delighted to be able to share that I’ve been awarded one of five 2025
[Better Scientific Software Fellowships][bsswf] by the [Better Scientific
Software][bssw] (BSSw) community. It’s very exciting to have BSSw support my
efforts to deliver better technical documentation to the world!

The [BSSw Fellowship Program][bsswp] describes itself as giving “recognition and
funding to leaders and advocates of high-quality scientific software.” There’s
an annual competition on the basis of a mercifully brief written application,
with fellows being awarded $25,000 to conduct a project that promotes better
scientific software, in some fashion.

Here’s my project proposal, exactly as written in my application:

> As a BSSw Fellow I would teach scientific software developers how to create
> better documentation. For many, the word evokes a feeling of guilt, or dread.
> Have I written enough? Is what I’ve written any good? While these questions
> might occur to any kind of developer, scientific software raises some
> additional ones: how do I integrate my documentation with the academic
> literature? How do I teach users about the links between physics concepts and
> code? How do I get professional credit for this work? I would construct an
> online learning resource aiming to answer these sorts of questions:
> documentation about documentation. It would present a conceptual framework for
> architecting technical documentation, strategies for creating effective
> documentation, and specific techniques for implementing those strategies. The
> content would build on my experience creating documentation for projects such
> as the HERA Librarian, DASCH, WorldWide Telescope, and Tectonic. For instance,
> while the Diátaxis system (<https://diataxis.fr/>) provides a valuable
> high-level framework for documentation design, it does not mention elements
> such as landing pages and finding aids, which I have found to be important in
> my projects. Diátaxis also (intentionally) does not provide guidance on
> specific tools to adopt. My resource would provide a set of suggested tools
> and templates supporting the needs of scientific software authors, such as
> cross-references to the academic literature and high-quality mathematics.
> Development of the resource would be iterative, involving community feedback
> and A/B testing of different documentation strategies within the resource
> itself. To enable this, I would seek to build community around the project
> through targeted outreach and conference talks. The scope of the project would
> be delivery of an end-to-end resource: one equipping scientific software
> developers with the basic conceptual and authoring tools they need to document
> typical projects satisfactorily.

Whenever I’m writing a proposal I try to ask myself, “Will I be happy if this
proposal is accepted and I actually have to do this?” In this case, the answer
is an emphatic “Yes!” If you’ve been reading this blog regularly you’ve probably
noticed that I regularly [have
documentation](@/2024/digital-docs-are-web-apps.md) [on my
mind](@/2024/digital-docs-have-apis.md) and fixate on software tools for writing
like [Upwelling](@/2023/upwelling.md) (see also [Jacquard], which I haven’t
actually written about yet!), [PubPub] (ditto!), and of course [TeX] and
[Tectonic]; you can think of [Diátaxis] as a tool for writing as well. It’s
going to be great to have some financial support that allows me to spend part of
my workdays actually building something relevant to this space.

I can already foresee one challenge, though. The BSSw Fellowship is about
helping other people but it is emphatically not about building novel tools ­— no
“research” allowed. And more and more, I feel like every digital documentation
tool that I’ve ever seen is only a partial solution at best; I see *so much*
potential to do better. It’s going to take a little bit of discipline to stay
focused on helping people right now, rather than getting derailed thinking about
what might be. I’m hopeful that maybe I can find some time and support to work
on that side of the equation, too, although the next year is going to be a busy
one for me (even moreso than usual, that is).

Regardless, you can expect at least a few updates about this project over the
next year-and-change. Based on other things that I will be keeping me busy, I
don’t expect to ramp up my BSSwF effort until later in 2025, but I’m excited to
get going!

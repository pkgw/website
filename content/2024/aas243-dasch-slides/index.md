title = "Slides From My AAS243 DASCH Presentation"
+++

[Here](./deck/) are the slides from my AAS243 presentation on [DASCH]. It was a
five-minute oral contribution, so there are only a handful of slides, but that’s
no reason not to post them. I’ve also prepared some brief [instructions on how
to navigate the deck in your browser][nav].

For posterity, here’s some info about the talk:

*Title:* Completing the DASCH Project

*Authors:* PKGW on behalf of the DASCH team

*Abstract:* DASCH (Digital Access to a Sky Century @ Harvard) is the effort to
digitize the majority of the Harvard College Observatory (HCO) Astronomical
Photographic Glass Plate Collection, a set of ~550,000 images of the night sky
spanning more than a century of observations. With the support of HCO, DASCH
scanning is resuming after a hiatus of more than two years. At the time of the
writing of this abstract (late September, 2023), scanning is 96% complete with
an estimated ~6 months required to finish. Efforts are underway to make the
complete DASCH lightcurve collection available for analysis, enhancing a unique
resource for time-domain astrophysics. Work is also ongoing to expose the full
richness of the collection in a sophisticated web interface that will interlink
the scientific data with archival and historical information, centering the
“women astronomical computers” without whose work this irreplaceable scientific
asset would not exist. I will report the current status of the scanning effort,
DASCH data availability, and the new web portal.

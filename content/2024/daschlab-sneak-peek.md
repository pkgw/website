[Recently](@/2024/fun-python-filtering-pattern.md) I mentioned that I’ve been
working on a Python package called [daschlab], which will be the recommended
analysis toolkit for [DASCH] data. It’s designed for interactive data
exploration, so I thought that I’d make a video giving a sense of what it’s
like.

I haven’t yet written up a *lot* of the needed documentation, but if you’re
feeling adventurous you can play with it today. Besides local installation,
[this MyBinder link][mybinder] will load up a JupyterLab environment with
daschlab installed. Any data that you download won’t persist, but you should be
able to try a few things out.

There‘s also some [API reference documentation][apidocs], but these docs are
intentionally low-level; there no installation instructions, tutorials, etc. That
kind of stuff will end up on [the main DASCH website][DASCH].

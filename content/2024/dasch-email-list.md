title = "Sign Up for the New DASCH Email List (Maybe)"
+++

I've created [a new email list for DASCH announcements and discussion][ml]. All
users of [DASCH] data are encouraged to [subscribe][ml].

[ml]: https://gaggle.email/join/dasch@gaggle.email
[DASCH]: https://dasch.cfa.harvard.edu/

My hope is that this list can start nucleating a community of DASCH users who
can discover common interests and help each other solve problems as they arise.
While I expect to remain the primary DASCH “tech support” contact for a while
yet, handling inquiries through a mailing list will make things a little more
public and transparent as compared to one-on-one email. I’d like to think that
will yield some long-term dividends.

Using email for community discussions is very *un-2024*, but I think it’s the
right fit for DASCH. I expect the list traffic to be quite low, honestly, and in
that regime I tend to think that email works better than dedicated apps/forums
like Slack, Discord, Discourse, or Zulip. Also, many DASCH users are, shall we
say, not always on top of the latest technology trends, and I think an
email-based solution will work well for people who might be put off by some of
the trendier options.

I chose [Gaggle Email][ge] as the email list service provider because it seems
focused on doing exactly what I want, and it’s not [Google Groups][gg]. The
general [state of the internet](@/2023/newsletter.md) has gotten to the point
that I’m avoiding services offered by the 800-pound gorillas of the tech world
whenever it seems feasible, and one of the nice things about using an
old-fashioned email list is that it *ought* to be the kind of thing that can be
uncoupled from the Google (*et al.*) octopus pretty easily. I’ll have wait to
find out whether that bears out in practice, though.

The other provider option that came up in my searching was [groups.io][gi]. It
largely seems fine as well, but I was a bit put off by the [grab-bag of
features][gif] that their service seems to have accrued over the years. I didn’t
find anyone that had anything bad to say about it, or anything, and odds are it
would be a totally fine choice as well. I do like their [Why Email Groups?][giw]
page, which overlaps a lot with why I think that an email list is the right
choice for the DASCH user community.

I’ve also updated [the DASCH website][dasch] to advertise the email list in as
many places as seemed reasonable. I’ll also reach out directly to DASCH users
that I’ve communicated with in the past. It’ll be interesting to see how many
subscribers show up that aren’t already known to me.

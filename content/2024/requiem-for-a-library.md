title = "Requiem for a Library"
+++

Earlier this week, the [CfA] community was notified that the [John G. Wolbach
Library][wolbach] would be shut down for budgetary reasons. The spin is that
it’s “integrating into the broader Harvard Library,”, but the staff are being
let go and the physical space will be repurposed, so I think it’s fair to call
it a closure. I wanted to try to write a few words about what I think is going
to be lost.

For context, Wolbach is one of the top astronomy libraries out there. I’ve
always heard it and the [Gilliss Library at USNO][gilliss] described as the
premiere astronomy libraries in at least the US, and possibly the world (hedging
because I simply don’t know much about the international context). The rule of
thumb was that if you were looking for a scientific book about astronomy, if
Wolbach didn’t have it, no one else did either.

Indeed, Wolbach’s collections served as a major foundation for setting up [ADS]
— I mean, [SciX][scix] ­— which, as anyone that interacts with me regularly has
heard *ad infinitum*, in my opinion stands with [ArXiv] as one of the most
important things to happen in science in the past 50 years. It may be true that
the backbone of ADS is its comprehensive coverage of the astronomy periodicals,
but the kind of thing that makes ADS stand above other literature databases is
that it *also* has comprehensive coverage of books, theses, and other kinds of
literature. It is not a coincidence that the home of Wolbach is also the home of
ADS. I mean, SciX.

That being said, the other big thing about Wolbach is that it has been way, way
ahead of the curve in demonstrating that **libraries are not about books**.
(Echoes of [Dijkstra, maybe][1]: “Computer science is no more about computers
than astronomy is about telescopes.”) One of the things that was immensely
dispiriting about the presentation of the Wolbach closure was the focus on book
borrowing rates: I think the number might have been something like 0.6 books per
day, and decreasing. No kidding! We have the internet now! The CfA has been very
lucky to have a library staffed by people who understood this truth and worked
very hard to not just to think about but to demonstrate how libraries can stay
relevant — dare I say essential? — in the 21st century.

Some of this had to do with nontraditional resources, like [the devices
collection][devices]. There are informatics projects, like [the UAT][uat] and
[MetaSat]. There’s extensive work in support of [software citation][swcite] and
preservation. There’s the [Library Space Technology Network][lstn]. There are
historical projects like [Project PHaEDRA][phaedra], an [historian-in-residence
program][hir], [EONS], and the [Women in Astronomy Bibliographies][wib], not to
mention significant library support and involvement in the [Plate Stacks] where
I now spend most of my time. The library has long tried to sustain professional
development activities within the CfA, which are sorely lacking, and supported
the rest of the community by providing meeting space and resources like [the
video wall][wall]. And, not to put too fine of a point on it, most of these
activities were supported by external grant funding. Does this seem like a
moribund book-lending outfit to you?

Former Wolbach head librarian [Daina Bouquin][daina] deserves special
recognition for being the visionary that instigated most of these efforts. She
also taught me that libraries are [memory institutions][2], a description that
has stuck with me since I first heard it. A good library is a Leviathan, in the
Hobbes sense, that wakes up every day hungry to organize and preserve knowledge.
The books are incidental.

And if you ask me, we’re in need of good libraries ­— say it with me — now more
than ever. Focusing specifically on science, lately it’s been seeming to me that
something has been coming unhinged in our profession. The amount of material
published every year is [growing unceasingly][3], but the rate of actual
progress feels like it’s flatlined at best. As with [the internet in
general](@/2023/newsletter.md), it feels like there is more and more *stuff* to
have to pay attention to and less and less clarity about what’s actually
valuable. Making it all the more depressing is the near-certainty that LLMs are
about to overwhelm all human communications with a tidal wave of garbage.
(They’ll also enable some truly incredible positive things! But all of the
evidence thus far indicates to me that the vast majority of their usages will
make life worse. If I turn out to be wrong about this, great.) I don’t know if
the best library in the world can actually do anything about this, but it sure
seems to me like we need some institutions that can take this firehose of
*information* and organize it into *knowledge*.

More broadly … not to be melodramatic, but with literal Nazis parading around
these days, we shouldn’t be taking for granted some of the library basics such
as “providing access to knowledge without reporting your interests to the
government” or “fighting against people that want to burn books”.

Unfortunately, it’s quite clear that the Wolbach decision is final. One the one
hand, I understand that if you’re going to lay people off, you can’t shop around
for feedback, and you can’t be wishy-washy once the decision is made. On the
other hand, I and many of my colleagues feel immensely dissatisfied with the
process that got us here. To paraphrase an astute observation from a coworker
(not sure if they would want to be named): yes, this is a decision affecting
jobs that basically needs to be handed down from on high. On the other hand,
this is also a *big* decision that speaks to the foundational values of the CfA
community. It demands discussion. I don’t know how you reconcile those two
things, but I feel like there has to have been a better way.

In all this broad talk of institutions and community, I don’t want to lose sight
of the fact that a number of my coworkers are losing their jobs. That sucks.
They’re great at what they do and have been working hard, often thanklessly,
especially over the past few years with the library very understaffed. All the
talk of a “purely budgetary decision” doesn’t soften the blow. I hope you all
swiftly land your next dream jobs and/or winning lottery tickets! Thank you for
being such wonderful colleagues.

I can’t resist bringing up one of my favorite examples of the kind of support
that I got at Wolbach that you’d be hard-pressed to find anywhere else. If

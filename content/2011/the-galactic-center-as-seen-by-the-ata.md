It’s been a little while since I’ve made any cool pictures. But lately, I’ve
been focusing on getting a rough-draft version of a large-scale map of the
Galactic Center from my ATA transient survey data. Here’s what I’ve got so far
— click on the image for the full-scale version:

{% end %}

There are some holes because it turns out that some of our fields were only
observed during the first season of observing, when we took data at a longer
wavelength that turned out to be very difficult to work with.

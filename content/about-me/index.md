I’m a scientist at the [Center for Astrophysics | Harvard &
Smithsonian](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/).

Because there are a lot of P. Williamses out there, I try to go by Peter K. G.
Williams in professional contexts.


# Research Interests

My core scientific background is in the field of astrophysics. I’m interested in
“extrasolar magnetospheres” — the magnetic fields of cool bodies beyond the
Solar System. My work has shown that very small stars and also “[brown
dwarfs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_dwarf),” the balls of gas that are
between stars and planets in size, have magnetic fields that are quite similar
to the ones we find planets around Earth and Jupiter — they’re just hundreds of
times stronger! These magnetic fields are essential ingredients in understanding
[habitability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_habitability), drive a
rich phenomenology of space plasma physics, and tell us about the internal
structure of these bodies.

It turns out that the best way to probe these magnetospheres is with the tools
of observational [radio
astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_astronomy), which is one of my
specialties. I’ve done a lot of work with large time-domain radio surveys and am
interested in novel radio instrumentation. Some of this work has been motivated
by studies of [Fast Radio
Bursts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_radio_burst) (FRBs) and
[gravitational wave events](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GW170817).

My research often combines data from across the electromagnetic spectrum,
however, including observations in the infrared, optical, ultraviolet, and X-ray
taken with a whole host of observatories, including
[Hubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Space_Telescope),
[Chandra](http://chandra.harvard.edu/), and
[ALMA](http://www.almaobservatory.org/). I’m interested in the statistical and
analytical techniques needed to perform joint analyses of such datasets.

A major reason that I’ve gotten into these areas is that I’m excited by
data-intensive, data-driven projects. I built the data management system for the
[HERA](https://reionization.org/) project and overhauled the data infrastructure
for [DASCH](https://dasch.cfa.harvard.edu/). Beyond task-specific data analysis
pipelines and tools, I’m interested in developing astronomy’s data
infrastructure and broader efforts to make research data more open and
[FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/).

The foundation for this work is my deep experience with open-source software
development and research software engineering. I’ve been contributing to
open-source software projects for multiple decades and am currently a core
member of the [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/) scientific software
packaging project. I am extremely eager to build bridges between the open-source
and research software communities, which are often much more separate than you
might think.

Broadly speaking, I’m fascinated by the ways that digital technology can
transform and improve the practice of science. Some of the largest opportunities
that I see are in the systems by which scientific data and knowledge are shared,
both among professionals and in society at large. In the realm of formal
scholarly publishing, I served as Innovation Scientist in the
[AAS](https://aas.org/) Publishing group, advising on technology strategy and
editing the [Bulletin of the AAS](https://baas.aas.org/). I help moderate
submissions to [arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/).

My interest in scholarly communication extends beyond the traditional channels.
At AAS I was also the Director of the [WorldWide
Telescope](https://worldwidetelescope.org/) project, a first-class example of
how the graphics technologies developed for the Web can make it easy for
researchers to develop beautiful, bespoke visualizations. I remain a major
contributor. I

which allows me to include
{{ulink(path="2017/07/variable-and-polarized-radio-emission-from-the-t6-brown-dwarf-wisep-j112254-73255021-5/",text="fancy interactive animations")}}.
I have spent more time in the guts of [TeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX)
than any person really ought to, including launching the [Tectonic
Project](https://tectonic-typesetting.github.io/), which aims to keep the
venerable TeX typesetting system relevant in the 21st century.

I’m also interested things that aren’t science! But this isn’t the website for
talking about that.


# Short Biography

I did my undergraduate work at [Harvard](https://fas.harvard.edu/). I obtained
my PhD with Geoff Bower at the [UC Berkeley Department of
Astronomy](https://astro.berkeley.edu/), where I conducted some of the first
scientific studies using the [Allen Telescope Array](https://www.seti.org/ata).

In 2012 I came to the CfA to work as a postdoc in [the group of Prof. Edo
Berger](https://www.transients.science/), mainly doing time-domain radio
astronomy. From 2018 to 2022 I held a joint appointment as the Innovation
Scientist of the CfA and the American Astronomy Society (AAS), and as Director
of the WorldWide Telescope project. Since 2023 I’ve been the scientific and
technical lead for [DASCH](https://dasch.cfa.harvard.edu/).

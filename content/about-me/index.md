I’m an astrophysicist at the [Center for Astrophysics | Harvard &
Smithsonian](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/). I currently serve as the
Technical Lead of the IAU [Minor Planet Center][mpc].

Because there are a lot of P. Williamses out there, I try to go by Peter K. G.
Williams in professional contexts.


# Professional Interests

I’m an astronomer by training, but for even longer than I’ve been a scientist,
I’ve been an open-source software developer. Broadly speaking, I’m fascinated by
the potential of technology to transform and improve the practice of science,
not to mention all other aspects of life.

Don’t get me wrong, though: I’m no “techno-optimist.” There’s a certain brand of
unquestioning Silicon Valley positivity that I find genuinely offensive — a
naïveté so blatant and, frankly, ignorant that it feels like it must be willful.
That’s why [Kranzberg’s First Law][kfl] is the tagline on my homepage. But it’s
also true that since I started taking my first steps into the world of research,
I’ve been struck by how much *better* we collectively could be at science, if
just the right tools would be brought to bear.

Getting down to the particulars:

- Most of my astrophysical work has been on the topic of “extrasolar
  magnetospheres,” showing that very small stars and even “[brown
  dwarfs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_dwarf)” (the balls of gas that are
  between stars and planets in size) have magnetic fields that are quite similar
  to the ones we find planets around Earth and Jupiter — they’re just hundreds
  of times stronger! These magnetic fields are essential ingredients in
  understanding
  [habitability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_habitability), drive a
  rich phenomenology of space plasma physics, and tell us about the internal
  structure of these bodies.
- It turns out that the best way to probe these magnetospheres is with the tools
  of observational [radio
  astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_astronomy), which is one of my
  specialties. My astronomical work has often combined data from across the
  electromagnetic spectrum, however, including observations in the infrared,
  optical, ultraviolet, and X-ray taken with observatories like
  [Hubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Space_Telescope),
  [Chandra](http://chandra.harvard.edu/), and
  [ALMA](http://www.almaobservatory.org/). I’m interested in the statistical and
  analytical techniques needed to perform joint analyses of such datasets.
- A major reason that I got into the above areas is that I’m excited by
  data-intensive, data-driven projects. I built the data management system for
  the [HERA](https://reionization.org/) project and overhauled the data
  infrastructure for [DASCH](https://dasch.cfa.harvard.edu/). Beyond
  task-specific data analysis pipelines and tools, I’m interested in developing
  astronomy’s data infrastructure and broader efforts to make research data more
  open and [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/).
- The foundation for this work is my deep experience with the kind of work
  that’s come to be called “research software engineering.” I’ve been
  contributing to open-source software projects for multiple decades and had a
  stint as a core member of the [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/)
  scientific software packaging project. I’m extremely eager to build bridges
  between the open-source and research software communities, which are often
  much more separate than you might think.
- Some of the largest opportunities that I see are in the systems by which
  scientific data and knowledge are shared, both among professionals and in
  society at large. In the realm of formal scholarly publishing, I served as
  Innovation Scientist in the [AAS](https://aas.org/) Publishing group, advising
  on technology strategy and editing the [Bulletin of the
  AAS](https://baas.aas.org/). I help moderate submissions to
  [arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/).
- My interest in scholarly communication extends beyond the traditional
  channels. At AAS I was also the Director of the [WorldWide
  Telescope](https://worldwidetelescope.org/) project, a first-class example of
  how the graphics technologies developed for the Web can make it easy for
  researchers to develop beautiful, bespoke visualizations. I
  {{ulink(path="2013/09/slides-for-scientific-talks-in-html/",text="write my talks in HTML")}}
  which allows me to include
  {{ulink(path="2017/07/variable-and-polarized-radio-emission-from-the-t6-brown-dwarf-wisep-j112254-73255021-5/",text="fancy interactive animations")}}.
  I’ve spent more time in the guts of [TeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX)
  than any person really ought to, including launching the [Tectonic
  Project](https://tectonic-typesetting.github.io/), which aims to keep the
  venerable TeX typesetting system relevant in the 21st century.
- At a more abstract level, I’d like to live in a world where those of us who
  identify as researchers or technologists can also comfortably identify as
  scholars too. I try to encourage an approach to engineering that takes itself
  seriously as a component of the scholarly enterprise.

I’m also interested things that aren’t science! But this isn’t the place for
talking about those.


# Short Biography

I did my undergraduate work at [Harvard](https://fas.harvard.edu/). I obtained
my PhD with Geoff Bower at the [UC Berkeley Department of
Astronomy](https://astro.berkeley.edu/), where I conducted some of the first
scientific studies using the [Allen Telescope Array](https://www.seti.org/ata).

In 2012 I came to the CfA to work as a postdoc in [the group of Prof. Edo
Berger](https://www.transients.science/), mainly doing multiwavelength
time-domain studies of ultracool dwarfs, gravitational-wave event counterparts,
and other variable phenomena. From 2018 to 2022 I held a joint appointment as
the Innovation Scientist of the CfA and the [American Astronomy
Society](https://aas.org/) (AAS), and as Director of the [WorldWide
Telescope](https://worldwidetelescope.org/) project. In 2023–2024 I was the
scientific and technical lead for [DASCH](https://dasch.cfa.harvard.edu/) and
prepared [DASCH Data Release 7](https://dasch.cfa.harvard.edu/dr7/). Since 2025
I have been the Technical Lead for the [IAU Minor Planet
Center](https://minorplanetcenter.net/). I was named a [2025 Better Scientific
Software Fellow](https://bssw.io/blog_posts/introducing-the-2025-bssw-fellows).

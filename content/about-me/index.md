I’m the Innovation Scientist of the
[Center for Astrophysics](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/) and the
[American Astronomical Society](https://aas.org/). I’m also Director of the
AAS [WorldWide Telescope](http://worldwidetelescope.org/) project. My
astrophysical research focuses on the magnetism of other stars and planets,
large surveys, and the techniques of radio interferometry.

As Innovation Scientist, my job is to make other astronomers’ jobs easier. The
new technologies of the 21st century present an enormous opportunity to
improve all aspects of the research enterprise — but working scientists don’t
have the time to chase every new fad that comes out of Silicon Valley. I try
to promote and build tools that help astronomers do their research faster and
better.

I’ve always been interested in computers and scientific communication, and I’m
particular keen to explore the intersection between the two. The
[AAS WorldWide Telescope](http://worldwidetelescope.org/) is a first-class example
of how the graphics technologies developed for the Web can make it easy
for researchers to develop beautiful, bespoke visualizations. I
{{ulink(path="2013/09/slides-for-scientific-talks-in-html/", text="write my talks in HTML")}} which 
allows me to include
{{ulink(path="2017/07/variable-and-polarized-radio-emission-from-the-t6-brown-dwarf-wisep-j112254-73255021-5/",
text="fancy interactive animations")}}. I have spent more time in the guts of
[TeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX) than any person really ought to,
including launching the
[Tectonic Project](https://tectonic-typesetting.github.io/), which extends and
reworks TeX in some key ways with the goal of providing the 21st-century
typesetting system for technical documents — both print and electronic — that
scientists, engineers, and in fact _everyone_ deserves.

My astrophysics research focuses on “extrasolar magnetospheres” — the magnetic
fields of cool bodies beyond the Solar System. My work has shown that very
small stars and also “brown dwarfs,” the balls of gas that are between stars
and planets in size, have magnetic fields that are quite similar to the ones
we find planets around Earth and Jupiter — they’re just hundreds of times
stronger! These magnetic fields are essential ingredients in understanding
[habitability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_habitability), drive a
rich phenomenology of space plasma physics, and tell us about the internal
structure of these bodies. It turns out that the best way to probe these
magnetospheres is with the tools of
[radio astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_astronomy), one of my
longstanding areas of interest. My research often combines data from across
the electromagnetic spectrum, however, including observations in the infrared,
optical, ultraviolet, and X-ray taken with a whole host of observatories, from
[Hubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Space_Telescope) to
[Chandra](http://chandra.harvard.edu/) to
[ALMA](http://www.almaobservatory.org/).

My other astrophysics research has included large surveys of the radio sky,
[Fast Radio Bursts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_radio_burst) (FRBs),
[gravitational wave events](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GW170817), and a
little bit of [exoplanets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exoplanet). Before
becoming the Innovation Scientist, I was a postdoc in
[the group of Prof. Edo Berger](https://www.transients.science/) here at the
CfA; before that, I was obtaining my PhD with Geoff Bower at the
[UC Berkeley Department of Astronomy](https://astro.berkeley.edu/).

Because there are a lot of P. Williamses out there, I try to go by Peter K. G.
Williams in [my publications](@/pubs.md).

I also do things that aren’t science! But this isn’t the website for talking
about that.

I’m giving my radio astronomy talk yet again, to the
[San Francisco Amateur Astronomers](http://www.sfaa-astronomy.org/) on
Wednesday, October 21st, at 7:30 PM at the
[Randall Museum](http://www.randallmuseum.org/). The abstract is identical to
that of [September’s talk](@/2009/public-talk-september-11.md). If you’ll be
in town, you should come on by!

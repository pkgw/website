Originally from [Orangette](http://orangette.net/2008/01/from-this-day-forth/).

- 1 ½ C whole milk
- 2 ½ T water
- 2 ½ T granulated sugar
- 3 oz bittersweet chocolate (70% cacao)

Finely chop the chocolate, preferably on a cold surface and quickly since it
will get melty.

In a medium saucepan, combine milk, sugar, water. Put it on medium heat and whisk
occasionally until the sugar is dissolved. Raise the heat to medium-high until
it just boils. Remove the pan from the heat and whisk in the chocolate.

Blend for a minute with an immersion blender or regular blender. *Warning:* the
volume of the liquid will expand **a lot** when doing this. Be prepared!

Makes 2 medium-sized mugs, drinkable immediately.

I write HTML presentations using [reveal.js]. One of the perks of doing that is
that I can integrate my slides right into this website! But since my slides are
designed for live presentation *by me*, they don’t come with any instructions or
even navigation cues. This page gives some basic guidance for people who aren’t
already familiar with how to use a [reveal.js] slide deck.

[reveal.js]: https://revealjs.com/

1. The most important fact: pressing the **right arrow key** will take you to
   the **next slide**.
1. The **left arrow key** will go back to the **previous slide**.
1. The **Home key** takes you to the **first slide**.
1. Yes, the **End key** likewise takes you to the **last slide**.
1. The **Escape key** toggles an **overview** of all slides. This view might
   perform poorly in a complex presentation.
1. In most browsers, the **F11 key** will send the view to **fullscreen**. This
   isn’t specific to reveal.js at all, but might be useful if you’re viewing a
   presentation.
1. Pressing the **‘s’ key** will open a popup window with a **speaker notes**
   view. Before you get excited about discovering my secrets, I’ll mention that
   I almost never write hidden speaker notes since, in my experience, I rarely
   find myself in a position to read and react to them. (But you can absolutely
   “View Source” and see how I compose things!)
1. If the screen goes black, you may have pressed the **‘b’ key**, which blanks the
   screen. Press it again to go back to seeing the slides.

The [reveal.js] framework supports “two-dimensional” navigation, where the up
and down arrow keys can navigate a second-order sequence of slides, but I’ve never
understood the value of this mode, and I don’t use it in my presentations.

Happy navigating!

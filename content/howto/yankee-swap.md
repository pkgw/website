The correct rules for a Yankee Swap:

1. Everyone who is playing brings one wrapped gift.
1. Draw numbers from a hat (or equivalent) to choose the order in which everyone
   will play.
1. The first person to go picks a gift, opens it, and shows it to everyone else.
1. The next person to go selects an unopened gift. They may optionally choose to
   swap it for the first person’s (opened) gift. Whoever ends up with the
   unopened gift opens it and shows it to everyone.
1. So on and so forth, with people able to steal *any* gift that has previously
   been opened.
1. When everyone has had their turn, the person who went first has the option to
   swap their gift with any other.

Commentary:

- There is no limit to the number of times one particular gift may be stolen.
- There is no “cascading” of swaps within a single turn.
- If your gift is stolen, you must accept (and open) the wrapped gift that the
  stealer gives to you.

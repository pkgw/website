If you have an [iRobot Braava jet 240] mop, you might find that hair gets
stuck in its wheel wells and is awfully hard to remove. The driveshafts seem
pretty well protected so this kind of thing doesn’t seem like *too* big of a
deal, but it will probably keep your mop running longer to clean the junk out
once in a while. Here’s how you can do it.

### Prerequisites

- *Clean workspace with bright overhead light*. Some of the screws to remove
  are in pretty deep wells, so a bright light that can shine straight down on
  the workspace is a big plus.
- *Magnetized Phillips head screwdriver with long, narrow shaft*. Because of
  the aforementioned deep wells for the screws, a screwdriver with a long
  narrow shaft is a essential, and magnetization makes replacing the screws
  *massively* easier.
- *Very thin but strong pry tool.* I used the tip of a nice paring knife.

### Steps

1. Remove the battery. I hope you didn’t actually need me to tell you this
   part.
1. Remove the while plastic cover on the springy part of the robot, as per
   [this YouTube video]. There are four screws to loosen. They *cannot* be
   fully removed! Some modest force will be needed to unlatch the plastic
   cover, but not much. Watch the interface between the cover and the spray
   nozzle.
1. Remove the main while plastic cover, as per the YouTube video. There are
   six screws to take out. The video doesn't show their locations well, but it
   shouldn’t be hard to find them at the bottom of six deep wells. Once again,
   only modest force is needed to remove the cover. The blue switch used to
   eject the cleaning pad may pop out here.
1. For each wheel you want to clean, hold the wheel in place and remove the
   screw right in its middle. I found that these screws were attached pretty
   tight. (I used my red-barreled Master Mechanic screwdriver with the PH1
   head.)
1. Pop off the wheel. I needed to use medium force, but there didn’t seem to
   be any tabs holding it in place.
1. Clean the inside of the wheel if there’s any stuff there.
1. Use the pry tool to remove the inner hub piece, the one with the little
   round plastic posts sticking in towards the motor assembly. Right at the
   bottom of the wheel assembly, there is a small tab on this piece holding it
   in place. I got my pry tool right in at the base of the tab and pushed
   outward, and the inner hub popped off after medium force was applied.
1. Clean any remaining stuff out of the disassembled wheel.
1. Pop the inner hub back on. All you need to do is line up the tab where it
   was before.
1. Pop the wheel back on and reattach its screw. It will need to mesh with the
   gears of the driveshaft but this is easy.
1. Clean the second wheel in the same way, if so inclined.
1. Return the main white plastic cover. Make sure to feed the blue rubber
   cover for the water reservoir through the appropriate hole. Use your
   magnetized screwdriver to reattach the six screws. Reattach the blue switch
   that ejects the cleaning pad; it took me a few tries to get the blue
   plastic to mate with the lever inside the robot body, but all you need to
   do is get them lined up and push with medium force.
1. Return the final plastic cover, making sure the nozzle assembly fits into
   the hole in the cover correctly. Refasten the four screws.

After doing this procedure the pump in my robot seems a bit noisier, but
otherwise the wheels are clean and everything seems fine!

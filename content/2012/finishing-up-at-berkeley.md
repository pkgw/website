Well, I’ve just filed my dissertation with UC Berkeley, so I’m essentially
done with my PhD! I’ve uploaded an electronic copy of my thesis
[here](@/dissertation.md). I’ll be giving an exit seminar summarizing my work
(and probably digressing a fair bit, because why not?) on Monday. It’s been a
great time at Berkeley, though I’m also pretty excited to return to Harvard to
work with [Edo Berger](http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~eberger/). Onward!

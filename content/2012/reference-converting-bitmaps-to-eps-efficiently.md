Yet another entry in a
[surprisingly](@/2011/reference-converting-pdf-directly-to-eps.md)
[long](@/2010/reference-postscript-to-png-conversion.md) series of reference
posts about converting image formats. Sometimes you have a bitmap plot that
needs to be converted to EPS for submission to a journal. My go-to command is
`convert foo.png foo.eps` but this can give bad results.

For a large PNG file, the best approach using standard tools that I’ve
discovered is to use the NetPBM programs:

```sh
pngtopnm figure.png |pnmtops -equalpixels -scale 0.24 -psfilter \
  -flate -noturn -ascii85 -nocenter - >figure.eps
```

Annoyingly all of these options seem to be necessary to give useful output.
The scale factor is the number of inches per 72 pixels; 0.24 gives you about
300 DPI.

The `pnmtops` documentation says that the `-flate` option (which turns on
compression and can be a huge deal for large images) sometimes produces busted
output. There’s also an `-rle` option that will be less efficient (especially
for bitmaps that don’t contain long stretches of single colors). The
documentation also references a program called
[`bmeps`](http://dktools.sourceforge.net/bmeps.html) that is claimed to do a
better job of this kind of conversion. The same seems to be said of
[`sam2p`](http://code.google.com/p/sam2p/), but one of the benefits of the
above command is that the NetPBM tools are installed on most Linux machines.

When all of these options are working, I can generate a good EPS that’s only
15% larger (on-disk) than the original PNG, which is pretty cool.

As part of my [BSSw Fellowship](@/2024/bssw-fellowship.md) project on scientific
software documentation, I’ve conducted free-form interviews with some of my
colleagues to try to learn a little about how working scientists are approaching
research software documentation in the year 2025. In this post I’ll report my
findings.

But first, some disclaimers. I’m describing an *extremely* modest undertaking.
While I’ve really enjoyed my conversations, and so have plans to interview a few
more people (reach out if you’d like to volunteer!), at the moment my sample
size is *n = 4*. Even if that sample size were a lot bigger, I’m not doing
structured interviews here (nor am I trained to do so), so this is far from
rigorous in any sense of the word. I’ve tried to pursue a group of interviewees
that’s relatively diverse, but … again, we’re talking about four people here.
Three of them are astronomers, and of course the set of people willing to sit
down and talk to me is a biased subsample of the universe of people working with
research software. All this being said, I suspect that the patterns I’m noticing
are likely to generalize pretty broadly.

If I had to choose one word to summarize how my interviewees felt about
scientific software documentation in general, I’d go with *dissatisfaction*. I
think it's fair to say that everyone I talked to has a real appreciation for
good documentation; but no small amount of that appreciation stems from its
rarity. Good documentation is hard to find. Part of the reason for that is
intrinsic: it’s hard to write well! But, based on my interviews, I’m not alone
in feeling that there are a lot of extrinsic factors holding things back,
especially authoring tools that are limited and limiting.

In that context, I was a little bit surprised that none of my interviewees
complained about documentation being *unappreciated*. A perennial — and
completely valid — complaint from scientific software developers is that they
don’t get the recognition that they deserve from their peers. I had expected
that at least one or two people would report that they were discouraged from
spending time on docs because it seemed like the results weren’t being valued.
No one, however, offered such a sentiment, although I didn’t make a point of
trying to elicit it either. Nor did anyone mention efforts to find ways to make
documentation work legible to the traditional academic reward structures (e.g.,
making docs citeable), which is another preoccupation when it comes to research
code. It could be that, given a baseline expectation that time spent on research
software is going to be underappreciated in general, a lack of appreciation for
time spent on software docs goes without saying.

In fact, only one interviewee specifically mentioned the connection between
funding and software documentation, or the lack thereof. I’m confident that the
potential impact of funding is obvious to everyone involved; it’s just that the
prospects for any kind of systematic financial support for software
documentation feel grim at best, at the moment. I can imagine the contours of a
pitch to change this: fundamentally, documentation is education, and education
deserves investment, right? Well, lately there’s less agreement on that point
than I’d like. But I’d be happy to argue that most students would learn not just
as well but actually *more* effectively from great software documentation than
from a great textbook: it’s hard to beat learning by doing.

title = "DASCH DR7 on ArXiv"

It’s been hard to keep up blogging with my getting settled in at the [MPC] and
(*gestures vaguely*) everything that’s been going on. So, this is going to be
a brief post. But it’s worth mentioning that [DASCH DR7] is now on [arxiv.org],
specifically at [arXiv:2501.12977][ahtml].

This is a proceedings submission corresponding to [my presentation at
ADASS][adass] this year. As such, it’s limited to just four pages, so it’s quite
brief; and it’s not formally refereed. But at the moment, it’s the best
available citeable artifact relating to DR7. And while much of the material will
be familiar to anyone who’s been reading this blog closely, it does contain
original discussion about the completion of the DASCH project, as I see it.
[The HTML rendition][ahtml] is pretty readable, I must say.

Unfortunately, ADASS proceedings have been slow lately — my [WWT submission from
2022][wwt22] still hasn’t been officially published! There’s no obvious reason
to expect this one to be done any quicker. Hopefully, this piece will be
superseded by a much deeper refereed publication soon enough, although the
hours-in-the-day constraint is ever-present.

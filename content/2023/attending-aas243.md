Like the title says: I’ll be attending [AAS243]! I’ll be in New Orleans the whole
week representing [DASCH] and [WorldWide Telescope][wwt].

I’m scheduled to give presentation [#336.07][talk] on *Completing the DASCH
Project* at 3:10 PM on Wednesday during the “Catalogs, Surveys, and Large
Programs” session. The abstract is:

> DASCH (Digital Access to a Sky Century @ Harvard) is the effort to digitize
> the majority of the Harvard College Observatory (HCO) Astronomical
> Photographic Glass Plate Collection, a set of ~550,000 images of the night sky
> spanning more than a century of observations. With the support of HCO, DASCH
> scanning is resuming after a hiatus of more than two years. At the time of the
> writing of this abstract (late September, 2023), scanning is 96% complete with
> an estimated ~6 months required to finish. Efforts are underway to make the
> complete DASCH lightcurve collection available for analysis, enhancing a
> unique resource for time-domain astrophysics. Work is also ongoing to expose
> the full richness of the collection in a sophisticated web interface that will
> interlink the scientific data with archival and historical information,
> centering the “women astronomical computers” without whose work this
> irreplaceable scientific asset would not exist. I will report the current
> status of the scanning effort, DASCH data availability, and the new web
> portal.

I’ll also be around for the Tuesday special session [“Securing Diverse Data and
It's [sic] Provenance to Enhance Time Domain Astronomy”][ss], during which [Josh
Grindlay][josh] will give presentation [#241.02][jtalk], also on DASCH.

I’ll also be busy on Sunday from 1 to 5 PM at the special session [“Effective
Astronomy Visualizations for Research, Outreach, and Learning”][viz], talking
about visualization and WorldWide Telescope.

Of course I’ll be at a bunch of other sessions too, but those are the main ones
on my calendar right now. Hope to see you there!

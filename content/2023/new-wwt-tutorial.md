title = "A New Tutorial for WWT Developers"
+++

*You may have noticed that this blog has been dormant for a long time. I’m
aspiring to change that! Lately I’ve been feeling like I’ve been neglecting the
scholarly side of my professional life, and to help correct that, I want to
start writing a lot more frequently. I’m going to ease in with some easy, brief
notes.*

One of my projects over the past few weeks has been to take a pass over [the
WorldWide Telescope documentation][1] and start writing [a new tutorial][2]
aimed at people who are interested in writing web apps based on the WWT engine.
This is, admittedly, a pretty niche target audience, but if you’re in that
audience, I hope you’ll check it out!

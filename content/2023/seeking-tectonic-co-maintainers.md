title = "Seeking Tectonic Co-Maintainers"
+++

As [I posted on the Tectonic GitHub Discussion area][1], I’m seeking one or more
people to serve as co-maintainers for the [Tectonic] project. Please send me an
email if you might be interested.

For a bit more context, [check out my Discussions post][1]. Basically, it’s
become clear to me that I just don’t have the bandwidth to maintain the project
as well as it deserves, and I can’t realistically expect that to change any time
soon. I’ve been reluctant to say that I’m feeling “burned out” on Tectonic
lately, but if I’m honest, that’s part of the situation. There are still a ton
of things that I want to do with the project, but I don’t have the energy or
enthusiasm to fix issues that other users are facing the way that I used to.

I’ve been reluctant to add other maintainers in the past since I have very
particular ideas about where I’d like to see the project go, and I felt that I
was able to tackle everything I needed to do to get it there. While I still have
a clear vision for what I would like to see in the project’s future, it doesn’t
feel like I can do everything myself anymore, and it’s not fair to everyone else
to bottleneck things on me. I still feel a little anxious about not
micromanaging everything that goes on in the project, but with any luck I’ll
soon be kicking myself for not taking this step sooner!

title = "Sneak Peek: DASCH Website Refresh"
+++

At the beginning of this year, I stepped in to work on bringing Harvard’s
[DASCH] project back online after a long period of inactivity. I should have a
lot more to share about this effort soon — it’s been a long haul, but things are
now in a good place, and I’m excited about the project’s prospects in 2024.

While most of my work has been on the backend — wrangling the data (about half a
petabyte all told), scanning hardware, and software pipelines — in the past
couple of months I’ve also worked on refreshing the project website. It’s not
fully launched yet, but there's enough for a sneak peek here:

At the moment, this site is largely a refactor of the pre-existing website,
which was, frankly, fairly confusing. In the coming weeks and months I hope to
improve that, especially for non-specialist astronomers that might be interested
in trying to use DASCH data. Stay tuned!
